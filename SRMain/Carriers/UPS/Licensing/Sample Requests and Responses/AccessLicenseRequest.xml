You hereby confirm that You have read and fully understand the End User Rights available here. The Agreement may be presented to You more than once in conjunction with Your access and use of UPS Technology.  Unless the version of the Agreement has changed, each instance serves to confirm the Agreement as mutually entered into and not to create an additional or separate agreement.

For purposes of the Agreement:

"Customer" means the Person that is your employer (1) and that has been assigned the UPS Account you use to register the first UPS Technology you access, if a UPS Account is required for such registration, (2) and that has been assigned the first UPS Account you use with the UPS Technology you access, if a UPS Account is not required for registration but is required for use, or (3) when the first UPS Technology you access does not require a UPS Account for registration or use; and

"You" means, as applicable, you as an individual and the Customer.

You represent and warrant You have reached the age of legal majority and, if applicable, You can form legally binding contracts under applicable law on behalf of the Customer related to the UPS Technology.  If at any time You are no longer authorized to form legally binding contracts under applicable law on behalf of the Customer related to a UPS Account, You may no longer use such UPS Account with UPS Technology.

5.2	Access to Proprietary Information.  You acknowledge and agree that You may disclose, or that UPS or the Support Providers may observe, Your information and data during the provision of Support Services by UPS or the Support Providers; and that such information and data shall be deemed non-confidential and thus, not covered by Article 7 hereof, unless UPS has agreed otherwise in a signed confidentiality agreement separate from this Agreement.
